    "1) The first step is to filter the data in different files that will be used for all the analysis. The filter will be keywords (in the meantime), the keywords are the platforms name (i.e. Nintendo, Playstation, Xbox), these keywords are searched in the text and the username. If there is no defined preference (not zero preference) in which platform the record was pointing to, it is inserted in both files.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ideal method to filter the data would be create a database of keywords asociated with each platform, so in every record when searching it could be calculated the probability of that text (according to all the words) to which platform it goes. This would require a model with N-Bayes, but like most predictive models it requires training, which we do not have at this moment.\n",
